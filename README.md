# Passcode-Guesser

This is a program that guesses a numerical passcode between 0 and 55 trillion, which is the base ten equivalant of guessing any random 7 digit password that has characters a-z, 0-9, & all special characters on a standard keyboard. This is only for educational purposes only. It has been designed to be completely useless for nefarious purposes.
